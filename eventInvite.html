      Ok, so you don't really have to bring a beer :) Grab your favorite tea,
      coffee, or other beverage and head over to house for some boardgame fun!
      Some keep in minds:
    </p>
    <ul class="content">
      <li>
        I'll have some snacks and we're ordering pizza, but bring food if you
        have special needs
      </li>
      <li>
        Got a game? Bring a game! We're throwing Sushi Go, Mind, and Exploding
        Kittens on tables to start :)
      </li>
      <li>I have a spare room and I'm not afraid to use it!!</li>
      <li>
        This is not a dress-up affair: pajamas welcomed (I'll be in mine!)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The address is: some address, Seattle, WA 98118</p>
