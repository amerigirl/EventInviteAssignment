      Ok, so you don't really have to bring a beer :) Grab your favorite tea,

    <ul>
      <li>I'll have some snacks and we're ordering pizza, but bring food if you have special needs</li>
      <li>Got a game? Bring a game! We're throwing Sushi Go, Mind, and Exploding Kittens on tables to start :)</li>
      <li>I have a spare room and I'm not afraid to use it!!</li>
      <li>This is not a dress-up affair: pajamas welcomed (I'll be in mine!)</li>
    </ul>
